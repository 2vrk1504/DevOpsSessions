# Overview of Session 2

In this session, we covered the following stuff:

1. findViewById()
2. OnClickListener
3. Accessing properties of Buttons/TextViews using _get_ and/or _set_ methods.
4. Logic for a simple calculator.

Well commented code can be found in [MainActivity.java](./MainActivity.java).

Have fun! Check out [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), however our sessions will be in Java only. :P
